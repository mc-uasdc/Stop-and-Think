        <h1 style="color:MediumBlue  ;"><em><strong>Hey!!! I have some really important information for you.</strong></em></h1>
    
        <h2 style="color:navy;"><em><strong>~In wealthy countries,like United States and Canada, around 40 percent of wasted food is thrown out by consumers.</strong></em></h2>
     
        <h2 style="color:navy;"><em><strong>~25,000 people, more than one-tenth of the world's population, die everyday because of starvation.</strong></em></h2> 
    
        <h3 style="color:;"><em>40% of the food we buy, we just throw out. Wasting that much food is uncalled for and very rude. There is so many things one ca do to fix this. If you know you won't be able to eat all that food? don't buy that much, is that simple.(example~) Lets say you got a meal from <a href="https://www.bk.com/">Burger King</a>, You tried to eat it all but you just couldn't so now you got all your fries left. What should you do? Please don't throw it out, you can simple give them to a homeless person on your way home or to work, it will be much appreciated. Not only will you make that persons day but you will also be feeling better about yourself. In the other hand you can just save the food for later.</em></h3>

        <h3 style="color:;"><em><strong>-This could be you, And it doesn't take much. All it takes is to stop and think before throwing out good food.  </strong></em></h3>
        
        
     
        <h1 style="color:mediumblue;"><em><strong>There's more much you can do to help.</strong></em></h1>
        
        <h2 style="color:navy;"><em><strong>You can make a donation, to your local homeless people. The homeless almost always struggle with food insecurity. Homeless people sometimes can't access government programs and have to rely on what they can find the the streets or in shelter, if they get lucky.
